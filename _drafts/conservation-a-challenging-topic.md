This is the first article in a series of articles that relate to various forms of Conservation.

> We need all citizens to care, we need all citizens to believe, we need all citizens to engage, and we need to again make it understood that to be concerned about conservation is an act of citizenship.

I believe that this can be a challenging topic to discuss at times depending on one's viewpoint. In this post I will try and walk you through various types of Conservation as it at many different meanings.

Let's start by defining Conservation at it's very base level:

> Conservation may refer to the preservation or efficient use of resources (in an efficient or ethical manner), or the conservation of various quantities under physical laws.

There are many subtopics of Conservation and there are many sub-subtopics as well. In this instance I'll be covering the subtopic and sub-subtopics of:

### Conservation of biodiversity, environment, and natural resources
