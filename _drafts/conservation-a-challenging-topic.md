This is the first article in a series of articles that relate to various forms of Conservation.

> We need all citizens to care, we need all citizens to believe, we need all citizens to engage, and we need to again make it understood that to be concerned about conservation is an act of citizenship.

I believe that this can be a challenging topic to discuss at times depending on one's viewpoint. In this post I will try and walk you through various types of Conservation as it can have many different meanings.

Let's start by defining Conservation at it's very base level:

> Conservation may refer to the preservation or efficient use of resources (in an efficient or ethical manner), or the conservation of various quantities under physical laws.

To be clear, the terms *conservation* and *preservation* are frequently thought of as one and the same. This is not necessarily the case.  The [US National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/) offers the following explanation of the important ways in which these two terms represent very different conceptions of environmental protection ethics:

> â€³Conservation and preservation are closely linked and may indeed seem to mean the same thing. Both terms involve a degree of protection, but how that protection is carried out is the key difference. Conservation is generally associated with the protection of natural resources, while preservation is associated with the protection of buildings, objects, and landscapes. Put simply, **conservation** seeks the proper use of nature, while **preservation** seeks protection of nature from use.

Conservationists sought to regulate human use while preservationists sought to eliminate human impact altogether[^1].

There are many subtopics of Conservation and there are many sub-subtopics as well. In this instance I'll be covering the subtopic and sub-subtopics of:

### Conservation of biodiversity, environment, and natural resources

* [Conservation biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology), the science of protection and management of biodiversity
* [Conservation (ethic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_(ethic)), an ethic of use, protection, and management of the environment and natural resources
* [Conservation organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_organization) an organization dedicated to protection and management of the environment or natural resources
* Conservationist ([Conservation movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement)), a person who advocates for conservation of the environment and natural resources
* Conservation of natural resources:
  * [Habitat conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_conservation), land management practices to protect, manage, and restore habitat
  * [Wetland conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland_conservation), management to protect and restore wetlands
  * [Wildlife conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_conservation), protection of endangered species and their habitat
    * [Wildlife management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_management), management to conserve wild species and their habitats
