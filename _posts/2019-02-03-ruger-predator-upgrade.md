Ruger came out with their low cost American line of rifles a few years ago. It was about a year after their introduction that they announced a new model in their American Rifle lineup called the Predator, which featured a “heavier” weight barrel that was even threaded for a suppressor or muzzlebrake, all at a very low cost.

So several months ago I picked up a [Ruger American Predator](https://ruger.com/products/americanRiflePredator/specSheets/26973.html) chambered in 6.5 Creedmmor. 

Here are the basic specs:

* Barrel Length: 22 inches. 1:8”RH Twist. 5/8”x24 Muzzle Threads
* Overall Length: 42 inches
* Length of Pull: 13.75 inches
* Trigger Pull: Ruger Marksman Adjustable Trigger™
* The rifle tested measured 3# 6.5oz from the factory
* Capacity: Detachable AICS Magazine: 3+1
* Weight: 6.6 Pounds
* Stock: Lightweight synthetic with Power Bedding® integral bedding block system and soft rubber recoil pad. Also includes sling swivel studs.
* Sights: None. Comes with factory installed rail.

For the price I paoid for it it's not been a bad rifle at all although there are a few things I wasn't a fan of.
