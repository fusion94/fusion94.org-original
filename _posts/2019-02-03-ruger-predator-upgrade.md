Ruger came out with their low cost American line of rifles a few years ago and because they were all lighter sporter style rifles we initially had no real interest in them. It was about a year after their introduction that they announced a new model in their American Rifle lineup called the Predator, which featured a “heavier” weight barrel that was even threaded for a suppressor or muzzlebrake, all at a very low cost.

Several months ago I picked up a [Ruger American Predator](https://ruger.com/products/americanRiflePredator/specSheets/26973.html) chambered in 6.5 Creedmmor. For the price I paoid for it it's not been a bad rifle at all although there are a few things I wasn't a fan of.
